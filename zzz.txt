> 10.09.2024 [15:02:10] Fantastic sunshine today!
> 10.09.2024 [15:15:08] Fantastic sunshine today!
> 10.09.2024 [15:15:45] I feel awesome
> 10.09.2024 [15:16:43] Everything hurts, cannot stand the food and the music. Nothing cheers me up today.
> 11.09.2024 [08:54:31] Having a wonderful day!
> 11.09.2024 [09:01:06] Having a fantastic day with my friends
> 11.09.2024 [09:01:43] Horrible weather today. Raining all the time. Hate it
> 11.09.2024 [09:02:51] Normal, rather productive day. Nothing special, just usual stuff
> 11.09.2024 [09:27:04] Overall, it was a nice day. Sunny, calm, warm. I went for a walk in the park nearby, met some people I know from tango classes. Cannot say I was super glad, but still felt a bit better to have some human interaction.
> 11.09.2024 [09:28:48] Awful day. Impossible weather.
> 11.09.2024 [10:06:07] I hate today. Everything goes wrong. Cannot imagine a worse day
> 11.09.2024 [10:11:23] Went to see some exhibition today. Had a few pleasant surprises there, but apart from that, nothing special. The musium coffee was as horrible as it gets...Managed to stay aways from the cakes though! Yeaaay, good girl! My weight is so critical that I just have to.[D[D
> 11.09.2024 [12:05:03] What a lovely day today. The birds are singing, the sun is shining. Feeling content and happy. So much good news lately. Lucky me.
> 11.09.2024 [12:06:24] So-so day. Just tired, I guess. Otherwise, ass is fine.
> 11.09.2024 [12:10:50] What a shitty day today
> 11.09.2024 [12:11:40] A pretty average day. Uneventful and almost boring
> 11.09.2024 [12:12:31] I don't mean to be a drama, but evrything seems to irritate me today...like on purpose...hate it
> 11.09.2024 [12:31:32] Pretty happy with my Diary-project progress. Nothing absolutely genious or extraordinary, but not bad for a newbie, I think.
> 11.09.2024 [13:01:22] Ehm, not sure that my last entry was a full success, so trying again. Expect some mess as an outcome, of course.
> 11.09.2024 [13:02:11] Bla-bla-bla Dracula-style entry today.
