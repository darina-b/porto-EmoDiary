A small project to demonstrate Python skills (Data&amp;Finnish course by Aalto university)

PROJECT: EmoDiary /STUDENT: Darina Bunak /COURSE: Programming //Professional Diploma in Data Analytics and Finnish Language 2024

1. IDEA >>>   This is a simple diary app meant to evaluate user's emotional dynamics over time and provide some daily support.
2. SOLUTION >>>   The sentiment analysis of the entries is based on NLTK modules and a txt-file, where the data is stored.
    The code is based on objects of custom classes. Analytical part uses pandas for speed and reliability.
    Collecting mood evaluation grades provided by user shall help calibrate sentiment analysis and improve auto-evaluation in the future.
3. FUNCTIONALITY >>>  Start = RUN. Exit = '0', Ctrl+C. User can: add an entry, read entries for several days, check stats on language, check stats on moods.
4. COMMENTS >>>   Although NLTK is widely recommended for language and sentiment analysis, in this case, it shows very poor reliability.
    Its basic built-in functions, e.g. tagging, raise a lot of questions. Part-of-speech evaluation is too often incorrect. 
    So is sentiment evaluation (I tried to adjust 'manually' but still pretty poor results). Despite the flaws, I decided to keep it for now 
    (too much time spent already) and replace it with a better module (e.g.BERT) later. So, expect strange results when choosing '3'.
5. TESTING >>> When prompted, use file name 'TEST' (file TEST.txt attached)

**IDEA**  

This is **a responsive diary app** meant to **evaluate user's emotional dynamics and provide daily support**.  
Potentially, keeping such a diary could **help a lot of people**, ranging **from the elderly** users living alone **to** the patients with **severe depression/ addiction/ anger control problems** etc. where a diary is **a part of prescribed therapy**.  

In the latter case, therapist's work is eased by **statistical features of the app**:  
* **Mood statistics** over certain period of time or on a certain date can reveal such trends as seasonal mental detetioration 
or show reaction of the patient to certain events. Looking into it and analysing trends together with the patient could boost theraputical effect.  
* **Language analysis** can deepen therapist's knowledge of dominating ideas and hint on underlying connotations in patient's mind

##  

**SOLUTION**  

**I.** The user is asked to enter the Diary's name or to create a new one. After that, the following options are available:  

*1. Add an entry*  
*2. Read entries added over a requested period  of time*  
*3. Check language statistics*  
*4. Check mood statistics*  

**II.** Once a new entry is added, the user is given a supportive reaction, based on the built-in sentiment evaluation.  
**Evaluation grades** are given in the range **0-100** and divide all sentiments into **3 categories**, i.e **bad** (0-29), **average** (30-70) and **good** (71-100).  

Examplary responses:  

- [x] **Bad mood >>** "Looks like it's not the best day ever? Sh*t happens. You'll try again tomorrow."  
- [x] **Average mood >>** "Perhaps, you think it's been just an average {day-of-week}, but objectively speaking, all is good, right? ;)"
- [x] **Good mood >>** "It seems you've had a pretty good day. Congrats! Keep going!"

**III.** After that, the user is asked to give their own evaluation of their mood:  
"**How do you rate this day yourself? Give it a score from 0 to 100:**"  

If the automatic evaluation did not match user's grade, the app will admit it and apologise: 
*"I see that I was wrong. Your rate will help me guess better in the future.Thank you!"*

**Collecting personal evaluation is important for two reasons;**  
* It collects data for future tuning of the evaluation model
* When the model is well-trained on a large set of diary-like data, it could potentially reveal subjectivity of user's evaluation.

**OBSERVATIONS**  

**1.** The highlights show that **347 cars** were sold in total in 2022. That corresponds to **10 different car brands** and **15 different models** sold across 2 countries. The **overall revenue** generated by all 10 car dealers in the two countries was **$9 071 000**. The **profit** reached **$1 119 000**.  

**2.** Although by area, **Botswana** is about two times smaller than South Africa, in 2022, its car dealers **generated 67.42% ($6 116 000) of the overall revenue** for both countries. The **South Africa**'s dealers contributed only **32.58% ($2 955 000) of the overall revenue**. These numbers roughly coincide with the **number of car dealers in each country**: 7 in Botswana and 3 in South Africa.  

**3.** The bar chart representing **top-3 most popular models**, in fact, displays 4 model names, which **do not show significant difference in number of sales**. The most popular car model among customers in 2022 was 3 Series(BMW) with 33 sales in total. It was closely followed by Qashqai(Nissan) with 32 sales. The third place by popularity was, however, shared by Polo(Volkswagen) and Rio(Kia) sold 29 times each.  

**4.** In terms of **revenue generated by each of the 10 car brands**, the figures are spread across a wide spectrum, ranging **from $228 000** by Renault **to $1 785 000** by BMW. The **profit** line, in general, **follows the revenue** trend with **two exceptions: Toyota and Ford**. Those two brands returned **significantly higher profits with respect to their revenue** figures.

**5.** The interactive map shows **uneven geographical distribution of the car dealer shops**, which suggests logistical consequences. Only two of the sales points are located on the coast (South Africa: Durban, Cape Town), while the rest are situated inland. Botswana's shops are clustered around big cities and have shorter distances between each other, in comparison to the shops in South Africa.

**6.** Unsurprisingly, the **biggest revenue in each country was generated in capital cities**: $2 006 000 (77 cars) in Gaborone (Botswana) and $1 263 000 (46 cars) in Cape Town (South Africa).

**INSIGHTS**  

Based on the OBSERVATIONS above, here are some points to consider further:
- **Is South Africa's demand covered** by the number of car dealers presented or **is the market undersaturated?** What is the **growth potential** there?
- **What is the average revenue by shop in each country?** In the capital? Outside of it? Which country/ location is more profitable?
- **What makes the most popular car models win?** Do they have anything in common? If so, do they indicate certain preferences by customers (fuel type/ engine size/ insurance policy/ colour?)
- **Toyota and Ford are worth further investigation**. What is the key to their success, customers' respect for the **brand or certain features** that can be found in other cars? If customers trust the brands themselves, will it be justified to cut off the least profitable models and extend the representation of these two well-loved brands? If it is about features or feature/price ratio, there might be other cars fitting this golden ratio and representing them might show similar profitability in the future.
- **Is there competition between closely located shops in Botswana (e.g. in the capital region)?** If so, could it be eliminated by e.g. segment separation or model distribution? **Is the logistical model optimised?** Wouldll it be cheaper if more shops opened in South Africa? What would be the best location to open them, on the coast or inland?
